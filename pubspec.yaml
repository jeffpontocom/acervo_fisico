# Após cada alteração neste arquivo executar:
# - flutter pub get

# Para publicar a versão no servidor local executar:
# - flutter build web
# Copiar arquivos resultantes para a pasta definida no servidor IIS

# Para publicar no github pages executar:
# - flutter pub global run peanut --web-renderer canvaskit
# - git push -f origin --set-upstream gh-pages (-f required because of the rebase)

# Para gerar a versão para Android tipo appbundle
# R8 is the new code shrinker from Google, and it’s enabled by default when you build a release APK or AAB. 
# To disable R8, pass the --no-shrink flag to flutter build apk or flutter build appbundle.
# - flutter build appbundle --no-shrink

# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/icons/ic_launcher.png
    - assets/icons/ufo.png
    - assets/icons/band-aid.png
    - assets/icons/private-key.png
    - assets/icons/data-management.png
    - assets/icons/magician.png
    - assets/images/caixaA3.png
    - assets/images/caixaA4.png
    - assets/images/gaveta.png
    - assets/images/indefinido.png
    - assets/images/pastaA3.png
    - assets/images/tubo.png
    - assets/etiqueta.svg


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Baumans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Baumans-Regular.ttf
    - family: Exo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Exo-Regular.ttf
    - family: MavenPro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/MavenPro-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/MavenPro-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
  #         style: italic
